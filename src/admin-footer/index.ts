If they do seem to be causing errors, you can fix or disable plugins individually via the GitHub repository https://github.com/Sustainable-Capitol-Hill/myturn-hacks or *if absolutely necessary* you can disable all of them via the "Footer Includes" options in MyTurn's Site Customization settings page.`,
